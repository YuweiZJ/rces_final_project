    "## Project Goals\n",
    "Air pollution such as fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), SO$_2$, NO$_x$, and CO can cause harm to human health and the environment worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016, outdoor air pollution was estimated to cause 4.2 million premature death globally. One of the main outdoor air pollution sources are household energy for heating and cooking(World Health Organization, 2022). \n",

    "In 2012, New York City (NYC) established the Clean Heat Program (CHP) to ban #6 heating oil, and switch to cleaner heating fuel which has fewer sulfur and reactive nitrogen emissions during combustion. The #6 heating oil ban started in 2012 and was completed in 2016 (Berger, 2021). The purposes of the project are to look at the impacts of CHP on air quality in NYC and to analyze the chemical composition changes in combustion emissions after heating oil conversion.\n",

    "The original datasets are on Air Quality System (AQS) API database in daily data format. The URL to load data has a one-year time period limitation together with one pollutant species limitation. Since the data I need is the longtime period with multiple air pollutant species, I wrote a for loop to grab all years' .json data to dataframe at once. There are two ways to apply the for loop, one is to use the dictionary to loop through all 7 pollutants for 22 years in both NYC and NJ, and the other is to put in the area and pollutant you want, and it gets 12 years data for that specific pollutants only. Since the dataset is huge, when applying the first method to run the full for loop, the server breaks down. Therefore I applied the second one. But the code that applies the dictionary and full loop is in the appendix section at the end.\n",

Therefore, the first step is to choose the site using the group-by in pandas. The difficulty to select the right dataset is that not all sites measure the same species, and maintenance and other operations which cause time gaps and repeated measuring during the same time are very common. The good thing is all the operations notes were recorded in datasets. In this case, it is important to plot the time continuity for each site and make sure the measurements are consistent and useful. \n",
