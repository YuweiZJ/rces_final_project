# Final Project Description
## Background and Scientific Question:
In 2012, New York City (NYC) established Clean Energy Program (CHP) to force New York City to shift from heavy heating oil to cleaner heating fuel. CHP banned #6 residential heating oil which has more sulfur and reactive nitrogen emission during combustion. The #6 heating oil ban started in 2012 and was completed in 2016. 
<br>

This project is looking at how CHP affected the air quality in NYC, especially after 2016 when the project finished. 

## Summary of Planned Analysis:

Get air quality daily data from Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) from 2010 to 2018: fine inorganic particulate matter (PM2.5) (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium), CO, SO2, and NOX levels. 

Match those data on the same timeline, looking at raw data, monthly mean, seasonal mean, and annual mean of each air pollutant and aerosol. Compare NYC with New Jersey. 

Calculate the total change from 2010 to 2018 (two years after the program was completed).
